      <p><em><strong>BSc IT Software Engineering</strong> student at Eduvos university.</em></p>
      <p>I am a strong leader and strategic thinker and take great pride in all tasks that are
      assigned to me. I strive to achieve tasks with the highest of standards. I am selfmotivated
      and enjoy being challenged</p>
      <p>I have learnt a lot in the various positions that I have held during my work experience. I
      have found that I have a passion specifically for Software Development within the
      Information Technology sector. I enjoy the challenges this presents and feel that this is
      the area where I would thrive.</p>
      <p>My goal is to pave a career for myself as a Software Developer within the Information
      Technology industry. I would like to contribute and create something unique that
      benefits the company and that also helps to develop and nurture my skills.</p>
